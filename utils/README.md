# Readme Generator ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache-orange)
    
    
## Description
This is a project using Node.js and the Inquirer package to generate a professional readme for users. A prerequisite to use this is having Node.js installed on the user's computer. The user can go [here](https://nodejs/org/en/) if they need to install node.js. The user then navigates to the folder containing index.js within their terminal, then user can run the command *npm init -y* to install the package.json files. Then the user will need to run *npm install inquirer* to install inquirer. Once this is done, the user can run *node index.js* to run the application. The user will see a series of questions regarding their personal project. After answering each question, a professional readme will be generated for the user in their *utils* folder.
